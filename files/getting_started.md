Download
========

### Mac & Linux
Open your terminal and type:

```
curl http://www.meteorkitchen.com/install | /bin/sh
```

You **need** to have <a href="https://www.meteor.com" target="_blank">Meteor >=1.0</a> installed.


### Windows

You can download windows installer <a href="/install/install_win.exe" _target="blank">here</a>.


**Note**

- Filenames are treated case sensitive.

- meteor-kitchen uses "curl" to download files. You can find "curl" for windows <a href="http://www.confusedbycode.com/curl/#downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.


Current version is 0.9.73
=========================

Click <a href="{{pathFor 'version_history'}}">here</a> to see the version history.


Upgrade to latest version
=========================

Just install it again. The installation script will replace all the files with the new versions. If you experience any problems then simply delete old meteor-kitchen directory and do clean install again.


CLI
===

You can run the generator by typing:

```
meteor-kitchen
```

Common usage:

```
meteor-kitchen <input_file_or_url> <output_directory>
```

The input file can be <a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">JSON</a> or <a href="http://www.yaml.org/" target="_blank">YAML</a>. If you prefer YAML, you'll need to install the <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/js-yaml" target="_blank">js-yaml</a> converter.

### CoffeeScript

With the `--coffee` option the generator will produce cofee files instead js. For this, you need the <a href="http://js2coffee.org/" target="_blank">js2coffee</a> converter to be installed:

```
meteor-kitchen <input_file_or_url> <output_directory> --coffee
```

### Jade

For <a href="http://jade-lang.com/" target="_blank">Jade</a> lovers, use the `--jade` switch and the generator will produce jade files instead html:

```
meteor-kitchen <input_file_or_url> <output_directory> --jade
```

The Jade converter is experimental (I wrote it in a rush). It's not 100% syntactically clean and will be improved in the future. It is, at least, super fast (long live my good old friend: C++).


### React (experimental)

Still under development, but now you can generate (very simple) **Meteor + <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a> + FlowRouter** apps (for example, try to build `example-minimal` or `example-accounts` application).

Use `--react` or `--blaze` command line switch:

```
meteor-kitchen <input_file_or_url> <output_directory> --react
```

**Note:** if you built your app with **blaze** and now you want to build it with **react** (or vice versa) then you need to **clean build** it (into the new directory).

React is not fully supported yet - work is in progress. See <a href="{{pathFor 'compatibility'}}">Blaze vs React compatibility table</a>.



### <span class="label label-danger">New!</span> Virtual Reality: A-Frame (experimental)

Just playing around with <a href="https://aframe.io/" target="_blank">A-Frame</a> + React. Now you can generate (very simple) **Meteor + React + FlowRouter + A-Frame** application.

See <a href="http://example-aframe-iss.meteorfarm.com" target="_blank">live example</a>  - it's International Space Station mini tour. Source code is <a href="https://github.com/perak/kitchen-examples/tree/master/example-aframe-iss" target="_blank">here</a>.


### Human language support

**Experimental feature:** since version 0.9.43, you can write application description in everyday English language:

```
meteor-kitchen input_file.txt <output_directory>
```

You'll need to install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/human2machine" target="_blank">human2machine</a> npm module which translates English text to JSON input for generator.

There is also **online** human2machine translator available <a href="http://example-human2machine.meteorfarm.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

Example input file is <a href="https://github.com/perak/kitchen-examples/tree/master/example-human" target="_blank">here</a>.

More info and docs will be added soon.


Input file
===========

The input is just a JSON or YAML file containing the application's description. You can write it manually using your favorite editor or use <a href="{{urlFor 'login'}}">kitchen-GUI</a> - visual application generator.

You can start with one of the minimal templates below, depending on whether you need a user account system in your app or not:

**Application without user account system**:

```
{
	"application": {

		"title": "Hello world!",

		"free_zone": {

			"pages": [
			],

			"components": [
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Or:

**Application with user account system**:

```
{
	"application": {

		"title": "Hello world!",

		"public_zone": {

			"pages": [
			],

			"components": [
			]
		},

		"private_zone": {

			"pages": [
			],

			"components": [
			]
		}
	}
}
```

As you can see, the **application** object is at the root and contains **free\_zone** or both **public\_zone** and **private\_zone**:

- If the application object has only a **free\_zone** then the generator will create code without a user account system and all pages will be accessible to all users.
- If the application object has both a **public\_zone** and a **private\_zone**, pages under **public\_zone** will be accessible only for non-authenticated users, and pages under **private\_zone** will be accessible only for authenticated users.

Each zone has **pages** and **components** arrays containing descriptions of top-level pages and components (for example menus) under that zone.


Pages and Menus
===============

### Minimal example

```
{
	"application": {
		"free_zone": {
			"pages": [
				{ "name": "home", "title": "Home page" },
				{ "name": "about", "title": "About" }
			],

			"components": [
				{
					"name": "main_menu",
					"type": "menu",
					"items": [
						{ "title": "Home page", "route": "home", "icon_class": "fa fa-home" },
						{ "title": "About", "route": "about" }
					]
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Copy & paste it into your text editor, save it as "example-minimal.json" and run the generator:

```
meteor-kitchen example-minimal.json ./example-minimal
```

That will produce a simple application with a navbar and two pages.

You can see a live example <a href="http://example-minimal.meteorfarm.com" target="_blank">here</a>

**Note:** You can find the source code for all examples <a href="https://github.com/perak/kitchen-examples" target="_blank">here</a>

###Here is the pattern for the input file structure:

* The **page** object has **name** and **title** properties. If a page is named "home" in the description file, the generator will produce a template named "Home" along with the following files: `home.html`, `home.js`, `home_controller.js`.

* **filenames** and **route names** are always written in **snake_case** (lower_case with underscores)

* **template names** are always in **CamelCase** with the first letter capitalized.

* The **menu** object has **name**, **class** and **items** properties. Each component must have a **name** property (menu is a component, more about components later).

* The property **class** (of the menu object) will be applied to the menu's `ul` html element.

* Each menu item has **title** and **route** properties. The **title** property is the menu's label, while the **route** property is the name of the route you want this menu item to link to.


Subpages
========

Each page can have subpages: e.g. a top level page can have a sidebar or tab-menu with links to subpages.
Also, a subpage can have subpages and so on - to an unlimited depth.

To produce this, add a **pages** array to any **page** object - in the same way as in **zone** objects:

```
...
{
	"name": "home",
	"title": "Home page",
	"pages": [
		{
			"name": "subpage_1",
			"title": "Home - Subpage 1",
			"pages": [
				{
					"name": "subsub_1",
					"title": "Home - Subpage 1 - Sub-Sub page 1",
					"pages": [

					]
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
...
```
Subpages will have the route name constructed from its parent's page route name and the subpage name separated with a dot.

In the previous example:

- "home" route name is "home"
- "subpage\_1" route name is "home.subpage\_1"
- "subsub\_1" route name is "home.subpage\_1.subsub\_1"

Now we can have new menu items linking to the newly-created subpages:

```
...
{
	"name": "home",
	"title": "Home page",
	"pages": [
		{
			"name": "subpage_1",
			"title": "Home - Subpage 1",
			"pages": [
				{
					"name": "subsub_1",
					"title": "Home - Subpage 1 - Sub-Sub page 1",
					"pages": [

					]
				}
			],
			"components": [
				{
					"name": "subpage_1_menu",
					"type": "menu",
					"items": [{ "title": "Sub-Sub page 1", "route": "home.subpage_1.subsub_1" }]
				}
			]
		}
	],
	"components": [
		{
			"name": "home_menu",
			"type": "menu",
			"items": [{ "title": "Subpage 1", "route": "home.subpage_1" }]
		}
	]
}
...
```

### Subpages example
The generator has several built-in examples. You can get a list of the available examples with this command
```
meteor-kitchen
```


To try out one of the examples, just run:

```
meteor-kitchen --example-subpages ./example-subpages
```

This will produce an application with pages and subpages.

You can see a live example <a href="http://example-subpages.meteorfarm.com" target="_blank">here</a>

**Note:** The source code for all examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/perak/kitchen-examples" target="_blank">here</a>


Frontend framework
==================

Currently, the generator can produce markup compatible with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/" target="_blank">semantic-ui</a> or <a href="http://materializecss.com/" target="_blank">materialize</a>.

**Note:** semantic-ui and materialize are not fully implemented yet.

To choose frontend framework, add "frontend" property to your application object:
```
{
	"application": {
		"frontend": "bootstrap3"
		...
	}
}
```

Or:

```
{
	"application": {
		"frontend": "semantic-ui"
		...
	}
}
```

Or:

```
{
	"application": {
		"frontend": "materialize"
		...
	}
}
```

**Note:** If you don't specify frontend framework, meteor kitchen will use "bootstrap3" by default.

There is "hello world" **example app** using semantic-ui <a href="http://example-semantic.meteorfarm.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Note:** The source code for all examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/perak/kitchen-examples" target="_blank">here</a>.


Visual Themes
=============

If you are using bootstrap, you can choose from one of <a href="http://bootswatch.com/" target="_blank">bootswatch</a> visual themes.

You can easily choose a theme for your application by adding the "theme" property:

```
{
	"application": {

		"title": "Hello world!",

		"frontend": "bootstrap3",
		"theme": "bootswatch-amelia",

		"free_zone": {

			"pages": [
			],

			"components": [
			]
		}
	}
}
```
In this example, the application will use "bootswatch-amelia" theme. You can see a list of bootswatch themes <a href="http://bootswatch.com/" target="_blank">here</a>


Components
==========

An application with empty pages is not very useful :). That's why Meteor kitchen allows you to add **Components**. Which are predefined and customizable visual elements that can be inserted into pages. They are the building blocks of your application.

The generator comes with several built-in components. And you can also write **your own** components (which we call "plugins"). More about plugins later.

You can insert components into pages by adding a **components** array into any **page** object:
```
{
	"name": "page_name",
	"title": "Page Title",

	"components": [
	]
}
```

The list of built-in components currently implemented into generator:

- `menu` - navbars, navs, side-menus and tab-menus

- `form` - for inserting/updating data (with validations)

- `data_view` - shows data from collections (with search and sort functions)

- `tree_view` - shows hierarchical data from collections in a tree

- `jumbotron` - cool big heading text with button (usually found in home pages)

- `markdown` - styled text written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">markdown</a>

- `div` - simple html `<div>` element

- `section` - simple html `<section>` element


The minimal structure of any **component** object is:

```
{
	"name": "component_name",
	"type": "component_type",

	... and properties specific for component of this type...
}
```

- `name` - used by generator to construct the component template name: parent template name + component name (will be in capitalized camel-case).
- `type` - used by the generator to determine the component's type. If type is not one of the built-in component types, the generator will try to find and execute a plugin with that name (more about plugins later). You can write custom components by specifying "custom_component" here. In that case you need to provide your custom html and js code. See "custom components" below.

### Jumbotron component

A page object with a `jumbotron` component should look like this:

```
...
{
	"name": "home",
	"title": "Home page",

	"components": [
		{
			"name": "jumbo",
			"type": "jumbotron",

			"title": "Hello world!",
			"text": "This is just an example",
			"button_title": "Learn more",
			"button_route": "about"
		}
	]
}
...
```

In this example jumbotron will be shown on the home page. Properties `title`, `text`, `button_title` and `button_route` are specific to the component of type `jumbotron`.

### Markdown component

The easiest way to add formatted content into pages is to write text with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">markdown</a>, save it into a separate file and then insert the component of type `markdown` into your page.

A page object with the `markdown` component should look like this:

```
...
{
	"name": "home",
	"title": "Home page",

	"components": [
		{
			"name": "text",
			"type": "markdown",

			"source_file": "path_to_your_markdown_file.md"
		}
	]
}
...
```
Property `source_file` is the path to the markdown file (relative to the input JSON file).

### Div component

The component of type `div` is just a simple html div tag that will be inserted into your page (or component).

The following example shows how to add a bootstrap row with two columns into a page:

```
...
{
	"name": "home",
	"title": "Home page",

	"components": [
		{
			"name": "example_row",
			"type": "div",
			"class": "row",
			"components": [
				{
					"name": "example_column_1",
					"type": "div",
					"class": "col-md-4",
					"components": [
					]
				},
				{
					"name": "example_column_2",
					"type": "div",
					"class": "col-md-8",
					"components": [
					]
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
...
```

Before we continue with components `dataview` and `form`, let's add some **mongo** collections into your program:

Collections
===========

To define collections, add the **collections** array to your **application** object:

```
{
	"application": {

		"title": "Example application",

		"collections": [
			{ "name": "customers" }
		],

		"free_zone": {

			"pages": [
			],

			"components": [
			]
		}
	}
}

```

Also, you can define collection fields:

```
{
	"name": "customers",
	"fields": [
		{ "name": "name", "title": "Name", "required": true },
		{ "name": "phone", "title": "Phone", "default": "-" },
		{ "name": "email", "title": "E-mail", "type": "email" }
	]
}
```

Fields are used by components such as `form` and `dataview` (the generator will "know" what input fields to generate in forms, what columns to show in the dataview etc.).

- `name` - field name
- `title` - field title shown in form labels, table headers etc.
- `required` - used in form validations
- `default` - default value in insert forms
- `type` - field datatype - used in form validations
*...and many more properties, see <a href="{{pathFor 'api_reference'}}">field object</a>*

**Note** that defining fields at the collection level is not mandatory - fields can be also set/overriden inside the `form` and `dataview` components.

**Nested objects**

You can name a field as `fieldName.subField` and your data will look like this:

```
{
	fieldName: {
		subField: ...
	}
}
```
*(that works in forms and dataviews)*


Queries
=======

Collection definitions are not enough to access data from the client - you need to publish your data from the server and to subscribe at the client.
Meteor Kitchen automatically generates publish/subscribe code - all you need is to add database queries into `application.queries` array:

```
{
	"application": {
		...
		"queries": [
			{
				"name": "all_customers",
				"collection": "customers",
				"filter": {},
				"options": {}
			}
		]
		...
	}
}
```

- `name` is query name - name it as you wish

- `collection` is name of database collection (defined in `application.collections`)

- `filter` is mongo filter expression - passed as first argument to `Collection.find()` and `Collection.findOne()`. **Note:** this is JSON (not .js) so you need to escape strings etc.

- `options` is second argument to `Collection.find()` and `Collection.findOne()`

This will produce **publication** code at your server. Publications can be restricted to specific [user roles](#user-roles).

**Subscription** code will be automatically created in client side route controllers for each page where you refer to any of these queries.

For example, if your page definition looks like this:

```
{
	"name": "customers_page",
	"title": "Customers",

	"query_name": "all_customers",
	"query_params": []
}
```

Your route controller will subscribe to (and wait for) "all_customers" query. 
Page controller will also subscribe to all queries used in page's components, for example:

```
{
	"name": "customers_page",
	"title": "Customers",

	"components": [
		{
			"name": "view",
			"type": "dataview",
			"query_name": "all_customers",
			"query_params": []
		}
	]
}
``` 

**To summarize:**

### Publish

Define all database queries in `application.queries` array and that will be published automatically. 


### Subscribe 

To subscribe from client refer queries in your pages and/or page components `query_name` property.


### Query params

You can use variables (query params) in your query's `filter` and `options` params by prefixing string with `:` like this:

```
"queries": [
	{
		"name": "customer",
		"collection": "customers",
		"filter": { "_id": ":customerId" }
	}
]
```
Here we defined param `:customerId` and you need to provide it's value in your subscriptions, for example:

```
{
	"name": "edit_form",
	"type": "form",
	"mode": "update",
	"title": "Edit customer",

	"query_name": "customer",
	"query_params": [
		{ "name": "customerId", "value": "this.params.customerId" }
	]

	"submit_route": "home",
	"cancel_route": "home"
}
```

`query_params` contains param definitions:

- `name` is parameter name. If query contains `:customerId` parameter name is `customerId` (without `:`)

- `value` can be anything - constant value, Session.get('something'), function() { ... } etc.


**Note:** 

- subscription code executes in route controller, so `this` in parameter value means RouteController.

- if route have parameter with the same name as query parameter, in that case you don't need to explicitly define it in `query_params` (as we do in this example) - generator assumes undefined query params are route params and will automatically produce `this.params.customerId`.


Joins
=====

Since version 0.9.38 you can define joins between collections.

Let's start with example:

We have two collections: Companies & Employees

Example document from `Companies` collection:
```
{
    _id: "CQKDzmqmQXGhsC6PG",
    name: "Acme"
}
```

Example document from `Employees` collection:
```
{
    _id: "dySSKA25pCtKjo5uA",
    name: "Jimi Hendrix",
    companyId: "CQKDzmqmQXGhsC6PG"
}
```

In this example `Employees` collection have foreign key `companyId` referencing `Companies` collection.

Now we want to do `Employees.find()` and get joined document that looks like this:

```
{
    _id: "dySSKA25pCtKjo5uA",
    name: "Jimi Hendrix",
    companyId: "CQKDzmqmQXGhsC6PG",
    company: {
        name: "Acme"
    }
}
```
*(note `company` member - it contains joined data)*

Meteor Kitchen uses [perak:joins](https://github.com/perak/meteor-joins) package to perform this.

Here is example how to define join between Employees and Companies in meteor-kitchen:

```
"application": {
	"collections": [
		{
			"name": "companies",
			"fields": [
				{
					"name": "name",
					"title": "Company name"
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"name": "employees",
			"fields": [
				{
					"name": "name",
					"title": "Employee name"
				},
				{
					"name": "companyId",
					"join_collection": "companies",
					"join_container": "company",
					"join_fields": ["name"]
				}
			]
		}
	]

	...
}
```

Take a closer look at "companyId" field definition:
```
{
	"name": "companyId",
	"join_collection": "companies",
	"join_container": "company",
	"join_fields": ["name"]
}
```

- **join_collection** is name of foreign collection to join with
- **join_container** is field name where to store document from foreign collection
- **join_fields** is array of field names we want to get from foreign collection

That's it - now any call to `Employee.find()` or `Employee.findOne()` will return documents from Employees extended with data from Companies.

Your employees publish functions will automatically return employees and companies cursor (companies filtered with employee.companyId).

**Note:** perak:joins package is experimental and will change in the future (and maybe another package will be used instead).

You can see a **live example** using joins <a href="http://example-invoices.meteorfarm.com" target="_blank">here</a>

**Note:** The source code for all examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/perak/kitchen-examples" target="_blank">here</a>.


Dataview Component
==================

The component of type `dataview` is used to show data from the database's collection with search and sort functions (data appears in a table - other view styles such as "list" and "gallery" are under construction).

A minimal application with a `dataview` component should look like this:

```
{
	"application": {

		"title": "Example application",

		"collections": [
			{
				"name": "customers",
				"fields": [
					{ "name": "name", "title": "Name", "required": true },
					{ "name": "phone", "title": "Phone", "default": "-" },
					{ "name": "email", "title": "E-mail", "type": "email" }
				]
			}
		],

		"queries": [
			{
				"name": "customers",
				"collection": "customers",
				"filter": {},
				"options": {}
			}
		],

		"free_zone": {

			"pages": [
				{
					"name": "home",
					"title": "",

					"components": [
						{
							"name": "view",
							"type": "data_view",

							"title": "Customers",
							"text_if_empty": "No customers here :(",

							"query_name": "customers",

							"insert_route": "",
							"insert_route_params": [
							],

							"edit_route": "",
							"edit_route_params": [
							],

							"details_route": "",
							"details_route_params": [
							]
						}
					]
				}
			],

			"components": [
				{
					"name": "main_menu",
					"type": "menu",
					"class": "nav navbar-nav",
					"items": [
						{ "title": "Home page", "route": "home" }
					]
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

In this example we have a collection of `customers` and a component of type `dataview` inside the `home` page.

Some of the `dataview` component properties are:

- `text_if_empty` - text to be shown instead of an empty table if the collection is empty.
- `query_name` - [query](#queries) name from `application.queries`
- `insert_route` - route name of an existing page (usually containing a form component) which will be opened when the user clicks the "insert" button.
- `edit_route` - route name of an existing page (usually containing a form component) which will be opened when the user clicks the "edit" icon.
- `details_route` - route name of an existing page which will be opened when the user clicks the item.

Each page route can receive params such as document `_id`. More about that later.

You can see a **live example** (also with form components) <a href="http://example-dataview.meteorfarm.com" target="_blank">here</a>

**Note:** The source code for all examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/perak/kitchen-examples" target="_blank">here</a>


Form Component
==============

The `form` component has the following structure:

```
{
	"name": "insert_form",
	"type": "form",

	"mode": "insert",
	"title": "New customer",

	"query_name": "customers",
	"query_params": [],

	"submit_route": "",
	"cancel_route": ""
}
```

- `mode` - `insert`, `update` or `read_only`
- `query_name` - query from `application.queries` array used in `update` and `read_only` mode forms to filter a particular document from the collection to be modified/displayed
- `submit_route` - route name of an existing page to be opened when the user hits the "submit" button
- `cancel_route` - route name of an existing page to be opened when the user hits the "cancel" button

**Common usage** of the form component is to put a subpage into the page containing the `dataview` component, add a `form` into that subpage and then in the dataview component specify `insert_route`, `edit_route` or `details_route` to point to the subpage containing the form.
To make it clearer let's see an example application with a dataview and an insert form:

```
{
	"application": {

		"title": "Example application",

		"collections": [
			{
				"name": "customers",
				"fields": [
					{ "name": "name", "title": "Name", "required": true },
					{ "name": "phone", "title": "Phone", "default": "-" },
					{ "name": "email", "title": "E-mail", "type": "email" }
				]
			}
		],

		"queries": [
			{
				"name": "customers",
				"collection": "customers",
				"filter": {},
				"options": {}
			},
			{
				"name": "customers_empty",
				"collection": "customers",
				"filter": {"_id": null}
			}
		],

		"free_zone": {

			"pages": [
				{
					"name": "home",
					"components": [
						{
							"name": "view",
							"type": "data_view",

							"title": "Customers",
							"text_if_empty": "No customers here :(",

							"query_name": "customers",

							"insert_route": "home.insert",
							"insert_route_params": [
							],

							"edit_route": "",
							"edit_route_params": [
							],

							"details_route": "",
							"details_route_params": [
							]
						}
					],

					"pages": [
						{
							"name": "insert",
							"components": [
								{
									"name": "insert_form",
									"type": "form",
									"mode": "insert",
									"title": "New customer",

									"query_name": "customers_empty",

									"submit_route": "home",
									"cancel_route": "home"
								}
							]
						}
					]
				}
			],

			"components": [
				{
					"name": "main_menu",
					"type": "menu",
					"class": "nav navbar-nav",
					"items": [
						{ "title": "Customers", "route": "home" }
					]
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

In this example we have a page named `home` with a `dataview` component and a subpage named `insert`.
Subpage `insert` has a `form` component named `insert_form`.

Now look:

- `dataview` component: `insert_route` property is set to `home.insert` (subpage containing the form).
- `form` component: `submit_route` and `cancel_route` properties are set to `home` (parent page containing dataview).

Form is using query `customers_empty`: this is the insert form and we don't need any data from this query - `query` is used just to point the generator to which collection to use (and which fields) for the insert.

Route params
============

Sometimes you need to pass route parameters via a page URL. For example, let's say we have a page for listing all customers.
On this page you want to implement an Edit button for each customer, which points to something like:
`/customers/edit/<customer_id_here>`

To do this, first let's define query object:

```
{
	"application": {
		...
		"queries": [
			{
				"name": "customer",
				"collection": "customers",
				"filter": { "_id": ":customerId" }
			}
		]
		...
	}
}
```

and then add the `route_params` property to your `page` object:

```
...
{
	"name": "edit",
	"route_params": ["customerId"],
	"components": [
		{
			"name": "edit_form",
			"type": "form",
			"mode": "update",
			"title": "Edit customer",

			"query_name": "customer",

			"submit_route": "home",
			"cancel_route": "home",
		}
	]
}
...
```
**Note:** property `route_params` is an array of strings.

In this example the `page` object has a param named `customerId` and we are using it inside the `query` filter: `:customerId`.

Now, let's pass this param to our `dataview` component via `edit_route` and `edit_route_params` properties:

```
{
	"name": "view",
	"type": "data_view",

	"title": "Customers",
	"text_if_empty": "No customers here :(",

	"query": {
		"name": "customers",
		"collection": "customers",
		"filter": {}
	},

	"edit_route": "home.edit",
	"edit_route_params": [
		{ "name": "customerId", "value": "this._id" }
	]

}

```

Property `edit_route_params` is a list of parameters to be passed to `edit_route`:

- `name` is the parameter name
- `value` is the parameter value


Here is a full example with `insert` and `update` forms:

```
{
	"application": {

		"title": "Example application",

		"collections": [
			{
				"name": "customers",
				"fields": [
					{ "name": "name", "title": "Name", "required": true },
					{ "name": "phone", "title": "Phone", "default": "-" },
					{ "name": "email", "title": "E-mail", "type": "email" }
				]
			}
		],

		"queries": [
			{
				"name": "customers",
				"collection": "customers",
				"filter": {}
			},
			{
				"name": "customers_empty",
				"collection": "customers",
				"filter": {"_id": null}
			},
			{
				"name": "customer",
				"collection": "customers",
				"filter": { "_id": ":customerId" }
			}
		],

		"free_zone": {

			"pages": [
				{
					"name": "home",
					"components": [
						{
							"name": "view",
							"type": "data_view",

							"title": "Customers",
							"text_if_empty": "No customers here :(",

							"query_name": "customers",

							"insert_route": "home.insert",
							"insert_route_params": [
							],

							"edit_route": "home.edit",
							"edit_route_params": [
								{ "name": "customerId", "value": "this._id" }
							],

							"details_route": "",
							"details_route_params": [
							]
						}
					],

					"pages": [
						{
							"name": "insert",
							"components": [
								{
									"name": "insert_form",
									"type": "form",
									"mode": "insert",
									"title": "New customer",

									"query_name": "customers_empty",

									"submit_route": "home",
									"cancel_route": "home"
								}
							]
						},
						{
							"name": "edit",
							"route_params": ["customerId"],
							"components": [
								{
									"name": "edit_form",
									"type": "form",
									"mode": "update",
									"title": "Edit customer",

									"query_name": "customer",

									"submit_route": "home",
									"cancel_route": "home"
								}
							]
						}
					]
				}
			],

			"components": [
				{
					"name": "main_menu",
					"type": "menu",
					"class": "nav navbar-nav",
					"items": [
						{ "title": "Customers", "route": "home" }
					]
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Custom components
=================

You can also write your own components and add them into pages.

**Note**: This is only for simple components (components that don't require special processing while generating the application). If you need advanced, complex components write <a href="#plugins">plugins</a> instead.

Add a custom component into a page and write your own HTML and JS code, like this:

```
{
  "name": "my_component",
  "type": "custom_component",

  "html": "...your custom html here...",
  "js": "...your custom js here..."
}
```

Or provide a custom template .html and .js files:


```
{
  "name": "my_component",
  "type": "custom_component",

  "custom_template": "something"
}
```

- `type` is set to `custom_component`. That requires you to provide custom HTML and JS templates.

- If `custom_template` is set to `something` then you need to provide `something.html` and `something.js`. Path is relative to the input json file.

Your HTML and JS code can contain anything. Your component can contain other components, can use query - in the same way as any other built in component.

To see custom components in action check the <a href="https://github.com/perak/kitchen-examples/tree/master/example-onepage" target="_blank">onepage</a> example.


Plugins
=======

In addition to built-in components (such as `form`, `dataview` etc.) you can write your own components called **plugins** using javascript (node.js).

Plugins are stored in the `plugins` subdirectory inside the meteor-kitchen installation dir. By default this is located in:

```
~/.meteor-kitchen/plugins/
```

You can create a subdirectory here and name it as you wish - the directory name will be used as the component type.

Meteor kitchen comes with two example plugins. Please navigate to the first example plugin directory:

```
cd ~/.meteor-kitchen/plugins/example1/
```

The directory contains two files:

- `plugin.js` is javascript code that is passed to node.js and executed by the generator while building the app. It should create html and js that the generator will insert into the page.
- `plugin.json` is a JSON file with plugin settings: here you can specify which meteor and mrt packages your plugin is using.

You can use plugins in your application by adding a component into a page and setting the component type to the same name as plugin directory:

```
...
{
	"name": "home",
	"title": "Home page",

	"components": [
		{
			"name": "example_plugin",
			"type": "example1",
			"properties": { "anything": "here" }
		}
	]
}
...
```

Component type is set to `example1`. This type is unknown to the generator so it will search the plugins directory for a subdirectory named `example1` that contains a file named `plugin.js`.
If a file `plugins/example1/plugin.js` is found, the generator will pass that file to "node.js" and execute it. This file will produce html and js content that will be inserted into the page.

You can provide a `properties` object with anything inside, that object will be passed to the plugin processing code.

Our "example1" `plugin.js` file contains the following code:

```javascript
var kitchen = require("meteor-kitchen");

// read input
var component = kitchen.getInput();

// create some static html or load html template from a file
component.html = "<p><strong>Hello! I am example plugin No.1:</strong> just a static HTML but I am pretty!</p>";

// this simple component doesn't need any js
component.js = "";

// write output
kitchen.setOutput(component);
```

Object "kitchen" is the bridge between the generator and the plugin code. It has two methods:

- `getInput`
- `setOutput`

Method `getInput()` returns the component description - a javascript object extracted from input file, in our example this is:

```
{
	"name": "example_plugin",
	"type": "example1",
	"html": "",
	"js": ""
}
```
Properties `html`, and `js` are automatically added by the generator. Those are output strings that our plugin code should fill with content.

Method `setOutput()` will pass "html" and "js" strings to the generator and these will be inserted into the page.

This is a really trivial example that shows how to write a custom component. Note that you can add any custom properties to the component object inside the input file and use them inside the plugin.


You can see a live application that uses two example plugins <a href="http://example-plugins.meteorfarm.com" target="_blank">here</a>

**Note:** Source code for all examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/perak/kitchen-examples" target="_blank">here</a>


Server Side Routes
==================

You can add the array `server_side_routes` to your `application` object and the generator will add router.map and route controllers:

```
{
	"application": {

		"title": "Hello world!",

		"free_zone": {

			"pages": [
			],

			"components": [
			]
		}
	},

	"server_side_routes": [
		{ "name": "example", "path": "/example", "source_file": "path_to_source_file.js" }
	]
}
```

- `name` is the route name. Example: `api.show.some_data`.

- `path` is the route path. Example: `/api/show/some_data`. If you leave this blank, the path will be automatically created from the route name.

- `source_file` is the path to the .js file (relative to the input JSON) which will be inserted into the controller `action` function (not mandatory).


OAuth
=====

In application with user account system, inside `application` object you can set:

```
	"login_with_password": true,

	"login_with_google": true,
	"login_with_github": true,
	"login_with_linkedin": true,
	"login_with_facebook": true,
	"login_with_twitter": true,
	"login_with_meteor": true
```

and provide OAuth keys in your settings passed to meteor. Example `settings.json` file:


```
{
	"oauth": {
		"google": {
			"clientId": "yourClientIdHere",
			"secret": "yourSecretHere"
		},
		"github": {
			"clientId": "yourClientIdHere",
			"secret": "yourSecretHere"
		},
		"linkedin": {
			"clientId": "yourClientIdHere",
			"secret": "yourSecretHere"
		},
		"facebook": {
			"appId": "yourAppIdHere",
			"secret": "yourSecretHere"
		},
		"twitter": {
			"consumerKey": "yourConsumerKeyHere",
			"secret": "yourSecretHere"
		},
		"meteor": {
			"clientId": "yourAppIdHere",
			"secret": "yourSecretHere"
		}
	},

	"public": {
	},

	"env": {
	}
}

```
Built-in login form will automatically show "Sign in with..." buttons.

You can prevent users from logging in with email/password (and leave only OAuth login) by setting `login_with_password` to `false`.



User Roles
==========

In applications that use the user account system, you can define multiple user roles and restrict access to any page to any set of user roles. Also, you can restrict access to collections.

First, you need to add a `roles` array to the application object:

```
{
	"application": {

		"title": "Hello world!",

		"roles": ["admin", "user"],
		"default_role": "user",

		"public_zone": {

			"pages": [
			],

			"components": [
			]
		},

		"private_zone": {

			"pages": [
			],

			"components": [
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Meteor kitchen will create code that adds a `roles` array to the user document automatically.
If you specify `default_role`, that role will be added to new users.
Each user can have multiple roles (`User.roles` is an array of strings).

### Restrict access to pages

You can restrict any page inside a private zone to any set of user roles by adding a `roles` array to your page object. **Note**: the `home_private` page should be accessible to all authenticated users (don't restrict the private home page to any role).


```
{
	"application": {

		"title": "Hello world!",

		"roles": ["admin", "user"],
		"default_role": "user",

		"public_zone": {

			"pages": [
				{ "name": "home_public", "title": "Public home page" },
				{ "name": "login", "template": "login" },
				{ "name": "register", "template": "register" },
				{ "name": "forgot_password", "template": "forgot_password" },
				{ "name": "reset_password", "template": "reset_password", "route_params": ["resetPasswordToken"] }
			],

			"components": [
				{
					"name": "left_menu",
					"type": "menu",
					"class": "nav navbar-nav",
					"dest_selector": "#menu",
					"items": [
						{ "title": "Home", "route": "home_public" }
					]
				},

				{
					"name": "right_menu",
					"type": "menu",
					"class": "nav navbar-nav navbar-right",
					"dest_selector": "#menu",
					"items": [
						{ "title": "Register", "route": "register" },
						{ "title": "Login", "route": "login" }
					]
				}
			]
		},

		"private_zone": {

			"pages": [
				{ "name": "home_private", "title": "Private home page" },
				{
					"name": "admin_panel",
					"title": "Admin panel",
					"roles": ["admin"]
				},
				{ "name": "logout", "template": "logout" }
			],

			"components": [
				{
					"name": "left_menu",
					"type": "menu",
					"class": "nav navbar-nav",
					"dest_selector": "#menu",
					"items": [
						{ "title": "Home", "route": "home_private" },
						{ "title": "Admin", "route": "admin_panel" }
					]
				},
				{
					"name": "right_menu",
					"type": "menu",
					"class": "nav navbar-nav navbar-right",
					"dest_selector": "#menu",
					"items": [
						{ "title": "Logout", "route": "logout" }
					]
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

In this example we have page "admin_panel" that is restricted to role "admin" - regular users (users with role "user") cannot access this page.
If you try this example, when you login into application you will not see "Admin panel" page because you are in the "user" role. Use the mongo shell to add "admin" to the `roles` array:

```
db.users.update({ _id: "YOUR_USER_ID" }, { $set: { roles: ["admin"] } })
```


### Restrict collections to set of user roles

You can choose which user roles are allowed to read, update, insert and delete documents from a collection:

```
{
	"application": {

		"title": "Hello world!",

		"roles": ["admin", "manager", "user"],
		"default_role": "user",

		"collections": [
			{
				"name": "customers",
				"roles_allowed_to_read": [],
				"roles_allowed_to_insert": ["admin", "manager"],
				"roles_allowed_to_update": ["admin", "manager"],
				"roles_allowed_to_delete": ["nobody"],
			}
		],

		"public_zone": {

			"pages": [
			],

			"components": [
			]
		},

		"private_zone": {

			"pages": [
			],

			"components": [
			]
		}
	}
}
```

In this example we have an application with three user roles ("admin", "manager" and "user") and we defined a "customers" collection with fine grained access rights:

- **read**: everybody (empty array means "everybody")
- **insert** and **update**: "admin" and "manager"
- **delete**: "nobody" - nobody can delete.

There are two predefined built-in roles: "nobody" and "owner":

**"nobody"** means restrict access to all user roles (including "admin").
**"owner"** means allow access only to document owner.

### Document owner

Document **owner** is by default user who inserted document.
Meteor kitchen generates code that sets a "createdBy" field in each document automatically in the "before.insert" hook.
In a collection object, you can define a custom "owner_field" - that is the name of the field that will store the user ID of the document owner.
If you set for example: `"owner_field": "ownerId"` then document.ownerId will be used to determine the document owner.

Example:

```
{
	"name": "customers",

	"owner_field": "ownerId",
	"roles_allowed_to_read": ["admin", "owner"],
	"roles_allowed_to_insert": ["admin", "user"],
	"roles_allowed_to_update": ["owner"],
	"roles_allowed_to_delete": ["nobody"],
}
```

In this example, we set following permissions:

- **read** - owner and users with "admin" role
- **insert** - only users with role "user" and "admin"
- **update** - only document owner can modify document
- **delete** - nobody can delete document


File Uploads
============

You can define a collection of type `file_collection` and the generated collection will be <a href="https://github.com/CollectionFS/Meteor-CollectionFS" target="_blank">FS.Collection</a> (instead of the usual "Mongo.Collection") and you can use it to store uploaded (or any other) files.

```
"collections": [
	{
		"name": "my_files",
		"type": "file_collection",

		"storage_adapters": ["gridfs"],

		"roles_allowed_to_read": [],
		"roles_allowed_to_insert": [],
		"roles_allowed_to_update": [],
		"roles_allowed_to_delete": [],
		"roles_allowed_to_download": []
	}
]
```

You can write the `_id` of uploaded files into a normal collection and automatically join it with the file collection like this:

```
"collections": [
	{
		"name": "my_files",
		"type": "file_collection",

		"storage_adapters": ["gridfs"],

		"roles_allowed_to_read": [],
		"roles_allowed_to_insert": [],
		"roles_allowed_to_update": [],
		"roles_allowed_to_delete": [],
		"roles_allowed_to_download": []
	},

	{
		"name": "my_collection",
		"fields": [
			{
				"name": "fileId",
				"input": "file",
				"file_collection": "my_files",
				"file_container": "fileObject"
			}
		]
	}
]
```

Now, when you upload a file into the "my_files" collection, write the file's `_id` into "my_collection" `fileId` and if you do:

```
MyCollection.find()
```

You'll get something like this:

```
{
	_id: "dySSKA25pCtKjo5uA",
	fileId: "CQKDzmqmQXGhsC6PG",
	fileObject: ...FS.File object...
}
```

#### Form

If you set `"input": "file"` in your field definition, the built-in form component will show `<input type="file">`. This feature is not perfectly implemented and will be improved in near future.
